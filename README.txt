Can this get you banned? Yes.

Mod includes:
- Spring Attack, Onslaught, and Super Leap unchained protection.
- Debilitate, Lockdown Blow, Shield Barrage & Shield Counter into Spring Attack
- Spring Attack into Wallop
- Wallop into Leap
- Shield Barrage & Shield Bash into Onslaught
- Onslaught Lock & Onslaught Auto Counter
- Spring Attack (when Wallop is on Cooldown), Onslaught, Shield Counter (when Spring Attack is on cooldown), Wallop (when Super Leap is on cooldown), Super Leap, Challenging Shout, and Super Leap auto cancel. Cancels deactivate for skills with full frontal block if a defense success has been detected.
- Charging Lunge (hit) into Super Leap
- Debilitate into Wallop


Multiple macros that chain form the same skill (Debilitate -> Wallop and Debilitate -> Spring Attack, for example) will conflict with each other.

Timing for Onslaught cancel is still WIP, it's hard to get it right.

The "Helper"s help prevent accidental unchained casts of certain skills.

Works with NGSP, but the cancels are bugged on PR. Does not work with Bern.

To implement: 
- Lockdown Blow, Shield Barrage & Shield Counter into Wallop
- Preference system to choose automatically between different skills (Wallop, Spring Attack or Onslaught)
- Debilitate, Lockdown Blow cancels if no Spring Attack or Wallop
- Auto counter on Wallop and Super Leap (AHK/RobotJS is better for this)
- Spring Attack lock, with the option to turn it off if Adrenaline Rush is on
- Auto pop beer and brooch (AHK/RobotJS is better for this)
- Combo Attack into Onslaught (when not moving)
- Auto Skate when a movement key is being held
