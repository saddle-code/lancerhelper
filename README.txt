Can this get you banned? Yes.

Multiple macros that chain form the same skill (Debilitate -> Wallop and Debilitate -> Spring Attack, for example) will conflict with each other. Choose one of the two and stick with it.

Timing for Onslaught cancel is still WIP, it's hard to get it right.

The "Helper"s are just there to prevent accidental unchained casts of certain skills.

Works with NGSP, but the cancels are bugged on PR. Does not work with Bern.
